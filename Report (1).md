Overview
The objective of this project is to aid Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit foundation, in selecting the most promising applicants for funding. By leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly neural networks, we aim to predict the success of various organizations based on historical data.

Data Preprocessing
Target and Features
Target Variable: IS_SUCCESSFUL

Feature Variables: APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT

Non-useful Variables: EIN and NAME were excluded.

Binning Cutoff Changes Across Optimizations
Baseline Model: The cutoff for APPLICATION_TYPE was set at 500 and for CLASSIFICATION at 200.

Optimization 1: No change in binning cutoffs.

Optimization 2: Adjusted cutoffs; APPLICATION_TYPE changed to 1000 and CLASSIFICATION changed to 1500.

Optimization 3: No significant change in binning cutoffs.

Models and Optimizations
Baseline Model
Architecture: Neural network with hyperparameter optimization.

Training: Data scaled using StandardScaler.

Evaluation: Loss of 0.5513 and accuracy of 72.59%.

Optimization 1
Data Preprocessing: Consistent with the baseline.

Architecture: Similar to baseline with hyperparameter optimization.

Training: Data scaled using StandardScaler.

Evaluation: Loss of 0.5564 and accuracy of 72.70%.

Optimization 2
Data Preprocessing: Adjusted cutoffs for binning.

Architecture: Increased neuron count.

Training: Data scaled using StandardScaler.

Evaluation: Loss of 0.5598 and accuracy of 72.72%.

Optimization 3
Data Preprocessing: Consistent with the baseline.

Architecture: Similar to the previous optimizations.

Training: Data scaled using StandardScaler.

Evaluation: Loss of 0.5599 and accuracy of 72.61%.

Summary
Despite multiple attempts to optimize the neural network model, the target accuracy of 75% was not achieved. Even with adjustments to binning cutoffs and model tuning, the models consistently achieved an accuracy of around 72-73%.

Recommendations
Feature Engineering: Experiment with different feature sets to potentially improve the model.

Other Algorithms: Consider using other machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest or SVM for better performance.

Advanced Techniques: Employing ensemble methods or more advanced algorithms might provide the necessary boost in model performance.
